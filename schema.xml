  <key name="interrupt-check-interval" datatype="integer" default="120"
       attribute="check_interval">
    <description>
      Value passed to Python's sys.setcheckinterval() function.

      This integer value determines how often the interpreter checks
      for periodic things such as thread switches and signal handlers.
      Setting it to a larger value may increase performance for
      programs using threads.  Setting it to a value &lt;= 0 checks every
      virtual instruction, maximizing responsiveness as well as
      overhead.
    </description>
  </key>

  <key name="threads" datatype="integer" default="4">
    <description>
      The number of threads which should be used to serve requests.

      The threads are placed in a pool and are used to serve requests
      received from the servers configured using &lt;server&gt;
      sections.  This does not constrain the total number of threads
      used by the application server; additional threads may be used
      for internal purposes.
    </description>
  </key>

  <multikey name="path" datatype="string">
    <description>
      This specifies additional paths directories which are inserted into
      the beginning of Python's module search path.  The set of directories
      specified is inserted into the beginning of the module search path in
      the order which they are specified here.  Note that the processing of
      this directive may happen too late under some circumstances; it is
      recommended that you use the PYTHONPATH environment variable if
      using this directive doesn't work for you.

The code here and in zope._app is more complicated than it needs to be.

Here's what I want to do:

- Move the definition of request and server factories to Python

- Register the server factories (aka server types) as utilities.
  

These let us rip out most of the code here. :)

Move the rest of the code here to zope.app.server.  The
zope.app.server package is just tha zope.app. customization of
zope.server.

Rename zope._app to zope.app.debug. Move the config function from
zope.app.debug into zope.app.setup.  Move the bootstrap code to
zope.app.setup.
